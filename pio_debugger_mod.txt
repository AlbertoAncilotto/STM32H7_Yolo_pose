C:\Users\UserName\.platformio\packages\tool-openocd\scripts\board\ in the file stm32f4discovery.cfg, instead of the line reset_config srst_only, test these options in sequence:

reset_config none
reset_config none separate
reset_config srst_only srst_nogate
reset_config srst_only srst_nogate connect_assert_srst
reset_config trst_and_srst srst_nogate connect_assert_srst
Ideally test the same config twice, once with NRST connected to the probe and one go without it connected.

Only those are interesting for which the openOCD error is different.
